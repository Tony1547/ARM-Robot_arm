## 10/6/2025 - Created Onshape DOC and made a readme  

Today I'm just trying to figure out the parameters of my project, so I made some limits in Onshape and started looking at some references online. The image attached is just a VERY rough sketch (It's getting pretty late for me). The plan for tomorrow is to research what motors I'll be using and basing the rest of the project on, and get more geometry done in Onshape (I think it'll be really cool if I can reuse some random motor off another mechanism, like a 3D printer or something, but we'll see).

## 10/7/2025 - CAD base of arm  

Today I spent around an hour and a half researching motors, and eventually I decided to use E Series NEMA 17s. These stepper motors, I feel, will be easier for me to program down the line when / if I get to assemble this project, and are very cost-effective, being around 4-8 dollars depending on which vendor you buy from. Anyways, I made my base plate into an octagon and added two motors to the bottom, allowing the plate above the base to rotate, meaning that I now have 1 axis on my robot :D. Tomorrow I will try to get two more axis done on the arm and start looking into what electronic specifications I'll actually need to control the stepper motors, but at the current moment, I'm feeling pretty good about this project. (feel free to check out the public CAD on OnShape btw) [one more thing, I think I spent at least 30 minutes trying to find the size specifications of the motor I decided to use before realizing there was a .step file from the vendor.]

## 10/8/2025 - Shoulder CAD  

Today, I spent a little too much time overthinking how I would implement the first pivot/axis of movement on the arm. Eventually, I decided on a simple pulley and belt system. The rest of the CAD should be easier, up until the wrist and claw, or gripper, or hand. I haven't really decided on what will be at the end of the arm yet; maybe something modular would be nice. But this will be the end of day 3 of working on the arm, and I'm quite happy with how it's turning out.![IMG_2298.jpg](https://blueprint.hackclub.com/user-attachments/blobs/proxy/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsiZGF0YSI6OTk1LCJwdXIiOiJibG9iX2lkIn19--b6fec1213176a9424f752b1f79300650f6600584/IMG_2298.jpg)![IMG_2297.jpg](/user-attachments/blobs/proxy/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsiZGF0YSI6OTk5LCJwdXIiOiJibG9iX2lkIn19--9ac1b73e3b63b0f1ba0e619e1a1cbac22bbf68eb/IMG_2297.jpg)
