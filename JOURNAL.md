## 10/6/2025 - Created Onshape DOC and made a readme  

Today I'm just trying to figure out the parameters of my project, so I made some limits in Onshape and started looking at some references online. The image attached is just a VERY rough sketch (It's getting pretty late for me). The plan for tomorrow is to research what motors I'll be using and basing the rest of the project on, and get more geometry done in Onshape (I think it'll be really cool if I can reuse some random motor off another mechanism, like a 3D printer or something, but we'll see).
